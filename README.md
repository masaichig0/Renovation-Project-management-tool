# Renovation-Project-management-tool
Excel tool to manage your renovation project. 

"I am a journeyman carpenter with over 10 years of experience in residential construction. Using my knowledge of the construction process, 
I have developed a renovation management tool that can help general contractors like you effectively manage construction projects. 
This tool not only corrects data entered by the user, but it can also predict construction costs for your project. I am excited to share this tool with anyone 
who is interested in using it."
